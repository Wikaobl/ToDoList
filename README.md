## Description

This is an user-friendly website designed to assist you with your daily tasks. Write down all your duties and add them to the chart. When you've completed a task for the day, just click the checkbox next to it, it will automatically turn into strikethrough text. If you wish to remove a task, a simple click on the "X" button.
In this project I used **JS, CSS and HTML**.
